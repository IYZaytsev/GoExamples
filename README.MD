## Purpose of this project
A web app in Golang utilizing REST and microservice architectural styles.
The web app performs CRUD operations on a mock database, simulating a school database system and
dashboard. The purpose of this project was to learn more about microservices and REST architectural styles
so that I could apply them to a more complicated project in the future.
